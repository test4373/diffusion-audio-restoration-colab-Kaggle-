# Overview

This repo contains the PyTorch implementation of [A2SB: Audio-to-Audio Schrodinger Bridges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11311). A2SB is an audio restoration model tailored for high-res music at 44.1kHz. It is capable of both bandwidth extension (predicting high-frequency components) and inpainting (re-generating missing segments). Critically, A2SB is end-to-end without need of a vocoder to predict waveform outputs, and able to restore hour-long audio inputs. A2SB is capable of achieving state-of-the-art bandwidth extension and inpainting quality on several out-of-distribution music test sets.

- We propose A2SB, a state-of-the-art, end-to-end, vocoder-free, and multi-task diffusion Schrodinger Bridge model for 44.1kHz high-res music restoration, using an effective factorized audio representation.

- A2SB is the first long audio restoration model that could restore hour-long audio without
boundary artifacts.


# Usage

## Data preparation

Prepare your data into a ```DATASET_NAME_manifest.csv``` file in the following format:
```
split,file_path,duration
train,PATH/TO/AUDIO.wav,10.0
...
validation,PATH/TO/AUDIO.wav,10.0
...
test,PATH/TO/AUDIO.wav,10.0
...
```
You could have multiple manifests, one for each dataset, and you could use different audio formats as long as ```SoundFile``` supports it. After you prepare all of them, write down their paths and names in config files under ```configs/```. 

We train our models on the permissively licensed subsets of the following datasets: FMA, Medley-Solos-DB, MUSAN, Musical Instrument, MusicNet, Slakh, FreeSound, FSD50K, GTZAN, and NSynth. 

## Training 

- For pretraining, the script is

```python main.py fit --config configs/pretrain.yaml```

- For T-finetuning, first copy the pretrained checkpoint to the T-finetune experiment folder as initialization. Then, T-finetuning resumes from this checkpoint. 

Here's an example of running T-finetuning of 2-splits. These 2 models will be trained separately. For the first split, run

```python main.py fit --config configs/t_finetune_2split_0.0_0.5.yaml```

For the second split, copy this config and modify ```model.train_t_min -> 0.5, model.train_t_max -> 1.0```, setup a different experiment name and path, and run training in a similar way. 

- Misc: you may need to adjust batch size, num devices, num nodes, and gradient accumulation in the configs based on your GPU configurations. 


## Inference

- If you would like to run inference of the entire dataset, use
```
cd inference/
python A2SB_upsample_dataset.py -dn DATASET_NAME -exp ensemble_2split_sampling -cf 4000
python A2SB_inpaint_dataset.py -dn DATASET_NAME -exp ensemble_2split_sampling -inp_len 0.3 -inp_every 5.0
```

- If you would like to run a simple bandwidth extension API for arbitrarily long audio with automatic rolloff frequency detection, use
```
cd inference/
python A2SB_upsample_api.py -f DEGRADED.wav -o RESTORED.wav -n N_STEPS
```

## Requirements

```
numpy, scipy, matplotlib, jsonargparse, librosa, soundfile, torch, torchaudio, einops, pytorch_lightning, rotary_embedding_torch, ssr_eval
```
