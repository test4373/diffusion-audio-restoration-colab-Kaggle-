#  Model Overview

## Description: 
A2SB uses a UNet architecture to perform inpainting on an audio spectrogram. It can fill in missing frequency bands above 4kHz (bandwidth extension), or fill in short temporal slices (currently supporting filling in gaps of less than 1 second). This model is for non commercial use only.

### License/Terms of Use:
The model is provided under the NVIDIA OneWay NonCommercial License. 

The code is under [NVIDIA Source Code License - Non Commercial](https://github.com/NVlabs/I2SB/blob/master/LICENSE). Some components are adapted from other sources. The training code is adapted from [I2SB](https://github.com/NVlabs/I2SB) under the [NVIDIA Source Code License - Non Commercial](https://github.com/NVlabs/I2SB/blob/master/LICENSE). The model architecture is adapted from [Improved Diffusion](https://github.com/openai/improved-diffusion/blob/main/LICENSE) under the MIT License. 

### Deployment Geography:
Global

### Use Case:
Research purposes pertaining to audio enhancement and generative modeling, as well as for general creative use such as bandwidth extension and inpainting short segments of missing audio.

### Release Date:
Github 06/27/2025 via github.com/NVIDIA/diffusion-audio-restoration
